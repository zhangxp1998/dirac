		"Executes CLI commands or scripts. " +
		"Use 'commands' for simple sequences of shell operations. " +
		"Use 'script' for complex multi-line logic, data processing, or when a high-level language like Python or Node.js is more efficient than shell scripting. Default language is bash" +
		"'script' are also very useful for combinatorial problems such as looping over 'swap and try' pattern" +
		"Scripts have full access to the file system and current environment, be careful. " +
		"In multi-root workspaces, use the @workspace:command syntax for standard commands. " +
		"Leverage the full power of the environment's interpreters (bash, python, node, etc.) to accomplish tasks with minimal round-trips.",
