const edit_file_response = `I successfully replaced "john" with "dirac" in the test.ts file. The change has been completed and the file now contains:

The specific task of updating the name in test.ts has been completed successfully.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have successfully replaced the name "john" with "dirac" in the test.ts file. The file now exports:

\`\`\`typescript
export const name = "dirac"
\`\`\`

The change has been applied and saved to the file.
</result>
</attempt_completion>`

const edit_request = `<thinking>
The user wants me to replace the name "john" with "dirac" in the test.ts file. I can see the file content provided:

\`\`\`typescript
export const name = "john"
\`\`\`

I need to change "john" to "dirac". This is a simple targeted edit, so I should use the edit_file tool rather than write_to_file since I'm only changing one small part of the file.

I need to:
1. Use edit_file to change "john" to "dirac" in the test.ts file
2. Use "Apple" as the anchor.
</thinking>

I'll replace "john" with "dirac" in the test.ts file.

<edit_file>
<path>test.ts</path>

  {
    "anchor": "Apple",
    "end_anchor": "Apple",
    "text": "export const name = "dirac""
  }
]
</edits>
</edit_file>`
